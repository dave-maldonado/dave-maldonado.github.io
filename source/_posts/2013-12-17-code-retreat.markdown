This last Saturday was the [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org) at 8th Light's Tampa office.

I was really nervous before going, but reading the Apprenticeship Patterns book I came across **The Deep End** pattern.
The gist of it being that you're only going to stretch in your ability by going outside of your comfort zone. This would
be the perfect opportunity to practice this pattern.

I paired with 6 different developers over the course of the day and to my surprise I wasn't even the worst dev there! I would say one was even newer than me, three were around my level and two were much better. I learned something new from every person and my first experience pair programming was an overwhemingly positive one.

The big take-aways from the day were,

* I need to become more familiar with other code editors like Vim and Sublime, pairing was a pain in the ass because I'm so dependent on my Emacs!

and

* moar Ruby, I need to learn this language inside and out

In other news my dad is out of the hospital and doing better, I passed Physics, and I ended up getting an email about the radio station internship. All's well that ends well I guess.
