so I've been back to school for two weeks now, some thoughts-

* The university is huge compared to HCC!

* I feel really old sitting in a first-year physics lecture.

* I've been programming a lot less since school started :(

The last point worries me but I have to get through this year of engineering pre-reqs
before I'm accepted into the Computer Science department. I hope it doesn't set me back.
