Well it's the end of the semester and I have my physics final tomorrow. This has been my worse semester yet. I ended up dropping my calculus class and I'm barely passing physics. My dad's in the hospital with blood clots and fluid in his lungs. The 'interning opportunity' at the radio station fell through and no luck turning anything else up.
