I guess a first post is as good as any for my backstory. I'm 30 and skipped going to 
college after high school. I spent a decade flailing about trying to figure out
what I was good at. I did a lot of odd jobs- pest control, retail, call center...

**many** call centers

I decided I hated these things and went back to school. Three years and two community 
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
Its during this time I discovered Computer Science. 

I've been mucking around with computers since I was a kid but somehow I had missed programming; 
I was only dimly aware of it then and was more interested in building computers and learning how the hardware worked. 
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning. This was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be. This was a *real* science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.

I've only been programming for a few years but I'm trying hard to catch up on lost time. 
I want to get a job where I can program while I'm studying CS at school. I applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost. So far this task has been rewarding and harder than I first imagined. I hope that it pans out but if not I'll keep trying.
