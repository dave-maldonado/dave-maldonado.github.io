I'm what you could charitably call a beginning programmer. I'm 30, skipped going to 
college after high school and have been generally flailing about since trying to figure 
out if I'm good at anything.

I did a lot of odd jobs- pest control, retail, call center...**many** call centers

I decided I hated these things and went back to school. Three years and two community 
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
During this time I discovered Computer Science. 

Now I've been mucking around with computers since I was a kid and was generally seen as the
'computer guy' in the neighborhood but somehow I missed programming back then, I was only 
dimly aware of it and was more interested in building computers and how the hardware worked. 
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning, this was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be, this was...a *real* science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.

I've only been programming for a few years but I'm hungry to catch up on lost time. 
I'm trying to get a job where I can program while I'm studying CS at school but it's 
proving to be difficult. I've applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company 
and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost. 
So far this task has been rewarding in itself and harder than I first imagined. 
I hope that it pans out but if not I'll keep trying. I'm ready to get on with my life.
