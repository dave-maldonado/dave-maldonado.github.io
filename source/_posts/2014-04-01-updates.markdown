I've had a couple of big events lately...

BABY!!!

Charlotte was born 3/25/2014 at a healthy 7 lbs 11 ounces. She's all I can think
about lately.

UNEMPLOYED!!!
=============

While I was in the hospital I found out I was being let go. Needless to say it's
a bad time and now I'm scrambling to find gainful employment. I've had a couple
of interviews that seemed to go well but ended up not getting a call back.
I'll keep at it though, it's now more important than ever.
