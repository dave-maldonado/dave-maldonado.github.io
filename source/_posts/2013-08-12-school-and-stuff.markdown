school
======

{% img /images/usf_entrance.jpg USF %}

In two weeks I start studying at USF. I'm pretty excited to make the transition from
community college to a university. I have two calculus classes and two physics classes
to do before I'm accepted into the Computer Science program but I'm (semi)confident I'll get
it done and get in.

stuff
=====

Besides the new school year there have been other developments, some I can't talk about
quite yet and some I can. I got into a wreck a few weeks back when I zoned out and jumped
the median into oncoming traffic. Luckily I came to as the car started spinning around and
miraculously ended up on the other side of the road unharmed. The car was out of commission
for a few weeks while I got to experience the local bus system...

There were a few belligerent (and amusing) drunks and some long walks after missing
connections but it wasn't too bad overall. Honestly for a while after that scare I
didn't want to drive.

I'm also working on my programming, the two things I'm currently occupied with are,

* [exercism.io](http://exercism.io): A 'coding exercise' website with an awesome code -> peer review -> refactor model

* [Coursera's Algorithms course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI): I tried
this course about a year ago but had a hard time, now I think I'm ready for it.

Well, I guess that's all I got for now, *auf wiedersehen!*
