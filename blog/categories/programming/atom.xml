    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m what you could charitably call a beginning programmer. I&rsquo;m 30, skipped going to
college after high school and have been generally flailing about since trying to figure
out if I&rsquo;m good at anything.</p>

<p>I did a lot of odd jobs- pest control, retail, call center&hellip;<strong>many</strong> call centers</p>

<p>I decided I hated these things and went back to school. Three years and two community
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
During this time I discovered Computer Science.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve been mucking around with computers since I was a kid and was generally seen as the
&lsquo;computer guy&rsquo; in the neighborhood but somehow I missed programming back then, I was only
dimly aware of it and was more interested in building computers and how the hardware worked.
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning, this was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be, this was&hellip;a <em>real</em> science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been programming for a few years but I&rsquo;m hungry to catch up on lost time.
I&rsquo;m trying to get a job where I can program while I&rsquo;m studying CS at school but it&rsquo;s
proving to be difficult. I&rsquo;ve applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company
and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost.
So far this task has been rewarding in itself and harder than I first imagined.
I hope that it pans out but if not I&rsquo;ll keep trying. I&rsquo;m ready to get on with my life.</p>
