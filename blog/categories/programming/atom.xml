    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So today I decided to re-install emacs from scratch.</p>

<p><img src="/images/why_would_you_do_that.png" width="400" height="400" title="why would you do that?" ></p>

<p>this started the usual way,</p>

<p><code>
$ brew install emacs --cocoa
</code>
and <em>voila!</em> I had a vanilla install of emacs.</p>

<p>I was using the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">starter-kit</a> before
but I had some problems with certain packages playing nice so I decided to look for
something new. Enter <strong>Emacs Live</strong>.</p>

<h1>Emacs Live</h1>

<p><img src="/images/emacs-live.png" title="Emacs Live" ></p>

<p>Sam Aaron makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMP-7POtML0">music</a> with code. He
live-codes his music using a <em>customised</em> version of Emacs. Apparently this is also a
nice setup for developing in Clojure, a language I&rsquo;m very interested in.</p>

<p>To install I cloned <a href="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live">the repository</a>
to .emacs.d.</p>

<p><code>
$ git clone https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live.git  ~/.emacs.d
</code></p>

<p>I started it up and played with some of the features (undo-tree!!!).
I couldn&rsquo;t leave well enough alone and wanted my pretty <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a> colors, so I got to hacking.</p>

<h1>Solarized</h1>

<p>I found a custom &lsquo;pack&rsquo; for solarized <a href="https://github.com/siancu/solarized-pack">here</a> but
it uses <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs">batsov&rsquo;s solarized-emacs package</a> which I could never get working with emacs running inside iTerm. I read a bit of the documentation and decided to roll my own user pack with <a href="https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized">sellout&rsquo;s color-theme-solarized package</a> (There are at least <strong>three</strong> different emacs packages for the solarized theme).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/documentation.html">documentation</a> explains how to
make a user pack and get it loaded into emacs. What I did with my user pack was to clone
sellout&rsquo;s package into the lib folder for the pack:</p>

<p><code>
$ cp -r ~/.emacs.d/packs/template ~/.live-packs
$ cd ~/.live-packs
$ mv user-template-pack dave-pack
$ git clone https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized ~/.live-packs/dave-pack/lib/emacs-color-theme-solarized
</code></p>

<p>then a little editing was needed to some files inside the pack:</p>

<p><code>cl ~/.live-packs/dave-pack/init.el
;; Solarized
(live-load-config-file "solarized-conf.el")
</code></p>

<p><code>cl ~/.live-packs/dave-pack/config/solarized-conf.el
;; Solarized theme configuration file
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.live-packs/dave-pack/lib/emacs-color-theme-solarized")
(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)
</code></p>

<p>I also needed to create ~/.emacs-live.el</p>

<p>``` cl ~/.emacs-live.el
(live-use-packs &lsquo;(live/foundation-pack</p>

<pre><code>             ;live/colour-pack ;disabled for solarized to work properly
             live/clojure-pack
             live/lang-pack
             live/power-pack))
</code></pre>

<p>(live-add-packs &lsquo;(~/.live-packs/dave-pack))
```</p>

<p>If you plan on running emacs inside a terminal emulator
set the XTERM to 16 colors. Also the undo-tree will not display correctly for
some reason</p>

<p>-and that was that! Now I have to spend some time installing my favorite
ruby packages, like rinari and rspec-mode. That can wait for another night.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess a first post is as good as any for my backstory. Grew up middle class
Army brat, rebelled in high school and skipped going to college afterward.
I spent a decade flailing about trying to figure out what I was good at. Tried a
few things- pest control, retail, call center&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>many</strong> call centers</p>

<p><img src="/images/call-center.jpg" title="my personal hell" ></p>

<p>All these jobs were terrible and I decided to go back to school. Three years and two community
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
Its during this time I discovered Computer Science.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been mucking around with computers since I was a kid but somehow I had missed programming;
I was only dimly aware of it then and was more interested in building computers and learning how the hardware worked.
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning. This was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be. This was a <em>real</em> science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.</p>

<p><img src="/images/computer-science-major.png" title="wat" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been programming for a few years but I&rsquo;m trying hard to catch up on lost time.
I want to get a job where I can program while I&rsquo;m studying CS at school. I applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost. So far this task has been rewarding and harder than I first imagined. I hope that it pans out but if not I&rsquo;ll keep trying.</p>
