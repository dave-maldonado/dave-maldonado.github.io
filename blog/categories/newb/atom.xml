    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This last Saturday was the <a href="http://coderetreat.org">code retreat</a> at 8th Light&rsquo;s Tampa office.</p>

<p>I was really nervous before going, but reading the Apprenticeship Patterns book I came across <strong>The Deep End</strong> pattern.
The gist of it being that you&rsquo;re only going to stretch in your ability by going outside of your comfort zone. This would
be the perfect opportunity to practice this pattern.</p>

<p>I paired with 6 different developers over the course of the day and to my surprise I wasn&rsquo;t even the worst dev there! I would say one was even newer than me, three were around my level and two were much better. I learned something new from every person and my first experience pair programming was an overwhemingly positive one.</p>

<p>The big take-aways from the day were,</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to become more familiar with other code editors like Vim and Sublime, pairing was a pain in the ass because I&rsquo;m so dependent on my Emacs!</li>
</ul>


<p>and</p>

<ul>
<li>moar Ruby, I need to learn this language inside and out</li>
</ul>


<p>In other news my dad is out of the hospital and doing better, I passed Physics, and I ended up getting an email about the radio station internship. All&rsquo;s well that ends well I guess.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended my first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb">Ruby meetup</a> a few weeks ago. I met some local developers and
may have a lead on an internship with a local radio station working on their Rails website. I&rsquo;m pretty excited :X</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess a first post is as good as any for my backstory. Grew up middle class
Army brat, rebelled in high school and skipped going to college afterward.
I spent a decade flailing about trying to figure out what I was good at. Tried a
few things- pest control, retail, call center&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>many</strong> call centers</p>

<p><img src="/images/call-center.jpg" title="my personal hell" ></p>

<p>All these jobs were terrible and I decided to go back to school. Three years and two community
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
Its during this time I discovered Computer Science.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been mucking around with computers since I was a kid but somehow I had missed programming;
I was only dimly aware of it then and was more interested in building computers and learning how the hardware worked.
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning. This was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be. This was a <em>real</em> science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been programming for a few years but I&rsquo;m trying hard to catch up on lost time.
I want to get a job where I can program while I&rsquo;m studying CS at school. I applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost. So far this task has been rewarding and harder than I first imagined. I hope that it pans out but if not I&rsquo;ll keep trying.</p>
