    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess a first post is as good as any for my backstory. Grew up middle class
Army brat, rebelled in high school and skipped going to college afterward.
I spent a decade flailing about trying to figure out what I was good at. Tried a
few things- pest control, retail, call center&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>many</strong> call centers</p>

<p>All these jobs were terrible and I decided to go back to school. Three years and two community
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
Its during this time I discovered Computer Science.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been mucking around with computers since I was a kid but somehow I had missed programming;
I was only dimly aware of it then and was more interested in building computers and learning how the hardware worked.
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning. This was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be. This was a <em>real</em> science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been programming for a few years but I&rsquo;m trying hard to catch up on lost time.
I want to get a job where I can program while I&rsquo;m studying CS at school. I applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost. So far this task has been rewarding and harder than I first imagined. I hope that it pans out but if not I&rsquo;ll keep trying.</p>
