    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>so I&rsquo;ve been back to school for two weeks now, some thoughts-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The university is huge compared to HCC!</p></li>
<li><p>I feel really old sitting in a first-year physics lecture.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been programming a lot less since school started :(</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The last point worries me but I have to get through this year of engineering pre-reqs
before I&rsquo;m accepted into the Computer Science department. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t set me back.</p>

<p>In two weeks I start studying at USF. I&rsquo;m pretty excited to make the transition from
community college to a university. I have two calculus classes and two physics classes
to do before I&rsquo;m accepted into the Computer Science program but I&rsquo;m (semi)confident I&rsquo;ll get
it done and get in.</p>

<h1>stuff</h1>

<p>Besides the new school year there have been other developments, some I can&rsquo;t talk about
quite yet and some I can. I got into a wreck a few weeks back when I zoned out and jumped
the median into oncoming traffic. Luckily I came to as the car started spinning around and
miraculously ended up on the other side of the road unharmed. The car was out of commission
for a few weeks while I got to experience the local bus system&hellip;</p>

<p>There were a few belligerent (and amusing) drunks and some long walks after missing
connections but it wasn&rsquo;t too bad overall. Honestly for a while after that scare I
didn&rsquo;t want to drive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also working on my programming, the two things I&rsquo;m currently occupied with are,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://exercism.io">exercism.io</a>: A &lsquo;coding exercise&rsquo; website with an awesome code &ndash;> peer review &ndash;> refactor model</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Coursera&rsquo;s Algorithms course</a>: I tried
this course about a year ago but had a hard time, now I think I&rsquo;m ready for it.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s all I got for now, <em>auf wiedersehen!</em></p>
