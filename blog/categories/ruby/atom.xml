    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This last Saturday was the <a href="http://coderetreat.org">code retreat</a> at 8th Light&rsquo;s Tampa office.</p>

<p>I was really nervous before going, but reading the Apprenticeship Patterns book I came across <strong>The Deep End</strong> pattern.
The gist of it being that you&rsquo;re only going to stretch in your ability by going outside of your comfort zone. This would
be the perfect opportunity to practice this pattern.</p>

<p>I paired with 6 different developers over the course of the day and to my surprise I wasn&rsquo;t even the worst dev there! I would say one was even newer than me, three were around my level and two were much better. I learned something new from every person and my first experience pair programming was an overwhemingly positive one.</p>

<p>The big take-aways from the day were,</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to become more familiar with other code editors like Vim and Sublime, pairing was a pain in the ass because I&rsquo;m so dependent on my Emacs!</li>
</ul>


<p>and</p>

<ul>
<li>moar Ruby, I need to learn this language inside and out</li>
</ul>


<p>In other news my dad is out of the hospital and doing better, I passed Physics, and I ended up getting an email about the radio station internship. All&rsquo;s well that ends well I guess.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended my first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb">Ruby meetup</a> a few weeks ago. I met some local developers and
may have a lead on an internship with a local radio station working on their Rails website. I&rsquo;m pretty excited :X</p>
