    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m what you could charitably call a beginning programmer. I&rsquo;m 30, skipped going to
college after high school and spent a decade flailing about trying to figure out
what I was good at.</p>

<p>I did a lot of odd jobs- pest control, retail, call center&hellip;<strong>many</strong> call centers</p>

<p>I decided I hated these things and went back to school. Three years and two community
colleges later I have an associate degree and got accepted to the local university.
Its during this time I discovered Computer Science.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve been mucking around with computers since I was a kid but somehow I missed programming back then,
I was only dimly aware of it and was more interested in building computers and how the hardware worked.
My first exposure to real CS was like a flash of lightning, this was totally different than
what I imagined a career involving computers could be, this was&hellip;a <em>real</em> science, like
Physics or Math, exciting and worthy of a lifetime of study.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been programming for a few years but I&rsquo;m hungry to catch up on lost time.
I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a job where I can program while I&rsquo;m studying CS at school but it&rsquo;s
proving to be difficult. I applied for an apprenticeship at a web-services company
and was challenged to write a tic-tac-toe program where the computer never lost.
So far this task has been rewarding in and harder than I first imagined.
I hope that it pans out but if not I&rsquo;ll keep trying. I&rsquo;m ready to get on with my life.</p>
